// ANALYSIS: Current vs LangChain RAG comparison
export const RAGComparison = {
  current: {
    pros: ["Simple implementation", "Easy to understand", "Lightweight", "Fast to implement"],
    cons: [
      "Mock/simulated retrieval",
      "No real vector search",
      "Limited document processing",
      "No advanced features",
      "Not production-ready",
    ],
    codeComplexity: "Low",
    features: ["Basic context formatting", "Simple document input"],
    performance: "Fast (but fake)",

      "Sophisticated text splitting",
      "Production-ready",
      "Extensible architecture",
      "Built-in optimizations",

    cons: [
      "More complex setup",
      "Additional dependencies",
      "Learning curve",
      "Potential overkill for simple use cases",

    reasoning: [
      "Current RAG is just a mock - not functional",
      "LangChain provides real RAG capabilities",
      "Better user experience with actual retrieval",
      "Future-proof architecture",
      "Industry standard approach",

    migrationStrategy: "Drop-in replacement with enhanced features",
    timeline: "1-2 weeks for basic replacement, 2-4 weeks for advanced features",
