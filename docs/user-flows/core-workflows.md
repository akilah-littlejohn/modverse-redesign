# Core User Workflows

## 1. Basic Model Comparison Flow

### Happy Path
1. **Landing** → User arrives at main interface
2. **Prompt Input** → User enters question/task
3. **Model Selection** → System suggests or user selects models
4. **Execution** → Parallel API calls to selected models
5. **Results Display** → Side-by-side comparison view
6. **Analysis** → User reviews and compares responses
7. **Action** → Save, share, or iterate

### Error States
- **No Prompt**: Show validation message, suggest examples
- **API Failure**: Show error, offer retry, suggest alternative models
- **Rate Limiting**: Show wait time, offer queue option
- **Network Issues**: Offline mode, cached results

### Edge Cases
- **Very Long Prompts**: Warn about token limits, offer truncation
- **Inappropriate Content**: Content filter warnings
- **Model Unavailable**: Auto-substitute similar model

## 2. RAG-Enhanced Comparison Flow

### Happy Path
1. **RAG Setup** → User enables RAG mode
2. **Document Upload** → User uploads or inputs context documents
3. **Processing** → System chunks and indexes documents
4. **Context Retrieval** → System finds relevant context for prompt
5. **Enhanced Prompting** → System augments prompt with context
6. **Model Comparison** → Enhanced prompts sent to models
7. **Results with Context** → Responses shown with context sources

### Error States
- **Upload Failure**: Show supported formats, file size limits
- **Processing Error**: Show progress, offer retry
- **No Relevant Context**: Warn user, offer to proceed without RAG

## 3. Collaboration Mode Flow

### Happy Path
1. **Diversity Detection** → System detects different model approaches
2. **Collaboration Trigger** → User chooses to enable collaboration
3. **Structured Interaction** → Models acknowledge each other's perspectives
4. **Synthesis Phase** → Models build on each other's ideas
5. **Consensus Building** → Democratic voting on key aspects
6. **Final Synthesis** → Collective intelligence output
7. **Transparency** → Full audit trail of collaboration process

### Error States
- **Collaboration Failure**: Fallback to individual responses
- **No Consensus**: Show areas of disagreement, partial consensus
- **Model Conflicts**: Mediation through conflict resolution

## 4. Advanced Analytics Flow

### Happy Path
1. **Usage Tracking** → System tracks all interactions
2. **Pattern Recognition** → AI identifies successful patterns
3. **Performance Analysis** → Cost, speed, quality metrics
4. **Optimization Suggestions** → AI recommends improvements
5. **A/B Testing** → Automated prompt optimization
6. **Reporting** → Comprehensive analytics dashboard

## 5. Team Collaboration Flow

### Happy Path
1. **Workspace Creation** → Team admin creates shared workspace
2. **Member Invitation** → Team members invited with roles
3. **Shared Resources** → Prompt libraries, templates, results
4. **Collaborative Sessions** → Real-time collaboration on comparisons
5. **Knowledge Sharing** → Best practices and insights sharing
6. **Team Analytics** → Collective performance metrics
